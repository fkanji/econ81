		This website provides two very important tools that can be used to both solve and understand several different problems in Microeconomics. The goal of this project is to not only allow users to find solutions to problems that involve Linear Programming and the use of Cramer's Rule, but also to help students understand the steps taken to solve these problems.

		Constrained optimization is a very important topic in Economics. A specific type of constrained optimization problem where all requirements are represented by linear relationships can be solved by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming"><u>Linear Programming</u></a> (or linear optimization). As long as we have linear relationships, we can use Linear Programming to solve several problems such as finding the maximum utility obtained by a consumer given a set of constraints or the optimum allocation of a finite amount of resources by a central planner. 
		<br><br>
		On this website, we present to you a tool that uses numerical methods to find the solution of a linear optimization problem where the user wants to maximize a certain utility condition (which can be utility for a consumer gained by consumption or revenue generated by a producer by selling products, etc.). In the special case where there are only 2 variables, the tool also presents the user a graph showing the feasible set of solutions. The user can visualize this set and ensure that indeed the correct solution is provided. The user can also use the slider under the graph to move the iso-utility line allowing the user to test other solutions as well.
		<br><br>
		We have also presented a Linear Programming Example section which goes in detailed steps to solve and visualize a linear optimization problem presented in Hoy, Michael <i>et al.</i> (2011) Mathematics for Economists. We hope that with the interactive example provided, students will be able to get a better understanding of the Linear Programming method.
		<br><br>
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cramer%27s_rule"><u>Cramer's Rule</u></a> has applications in many fields in addition to Economics. Cramer's rule is a neat and easy way to find the solution to a system of linear equations using matrices. On this website, we present a tool to solve a system of linear equations using Cramer's rule. Not only do we give the solution when a problem is entered, we also present a detailed step-by-step approach on how that particular problem is solved using Cramer's rule.
